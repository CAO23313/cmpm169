				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>What are you trying to acomplish with this experiment?</p>
				<p>I want to explore the theme of Noise as Information that uses voice/noise as base for visualization data.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Describe in detail what you did technically and how it works?</p>
				<p>I use a line chart to create a radio wave that visualizes the data of sound that has been detected, it will change color when it detects high-frequency sound, and also change the radio wave.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment.</p>
				<p>The most difficult part of this experimental artwork will be the ideation part, it takes a lot of time for me to think about the theme should I work on, buy the coding part is smoother than before, because I got a lot of experience from previous experimental.</p>
