				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>What are you trying to acomplish with this experiment?</p>
				<p>I want to explore vector art in this experimental assignment, by those inspired artwork examples, I can create my own experiment artwork.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Describe in detail what you did technically and how it works?</p>
				<p>I used two artwork examples and combined their code together for integration, and then added my own idea of a style kaleidoscope into the experimental artwork by editing the code. The program has three different modes that can be switched by pressing the number key 1,2,3. It will change the matrix to a different shape, and the scale of the matrix will be modified by the mouse pointer's position.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment.</p>
				<p>The most difficult part of this experimental artwork is modifying the code, I still need more practice to improve my skill in p5.js, therefore is very challenging for me to modify the code to work in the way I expect. However, I use chatGPT to help with editing and understanding as a useful tool, that helps me a lot. Finally, I got my final edition of the experimental artwork.</p>
