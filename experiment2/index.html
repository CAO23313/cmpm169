				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>What are you trying to acomplish with this experiment?</p>
				<p>I want to explore the generative method by using the theme of weather systems, I want to show the weather by rain and thunder.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Describe in detail what you did technically and how it works?</p>
				<p>I changed the background color to dark, so it has better performance for contrast each other, and also it gives a special feeling of a dark night. Then, I modified the code a bit to make sure all three draw modes show a different style of rain, and I also added a thunder system that will flash for a frame to simulate the thunder-like feeling. The draw mode could change by press keys 1,2,3.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment.</p>
				<p>The process of editing code and adding innovative things is very interesting, and the themes are giving me many possible ideas for me to explore. However, the hardest part was editing the code and making it work the way I wanted. I still need improvement for that part. But finally, I got something for my experimental artwork, and it made me feel excited.</p>
